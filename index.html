  <p>Sure ðŸŒ¿ Hereâ€™s the English translation of those lines:

    One tree is one life, so letâ€™s plant trees together.
    The first step to protecting the environment is planting more trees.
    Trees give us oxygen, shade, and safety for life.
    Planting a tree today ensures a healthy environment for the next generation.
    Letâ€™s take an oath â€“ **Plant trees, save the environment.**

    Do you want me to make them sound more like catchy poster slogans in English? ðŸŒ±
